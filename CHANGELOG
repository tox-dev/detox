# CHANGELOG

## 0.19

- as tox added a parallel mode in 3.7 detox will only work with older versions of tox now so the installation requires a version of tox < 3.7
- mark repository as unmaintained
- add a warning at the end of the testrun hinting the user to try it without detox and a version of tox > 3.6

    Bestwalter

## 0.13.0

- (fix [#283](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/283)) detox
    creates virtualenvs repeatedly and unnecessarily - by Thomas Steinke

## 0.12.0

    version constraint to <4.0 - by Pi Delport
- support and test with Python 2.7, 3.4+ - by Miro Hrončok

## 0.11.0

- #406: Add support for running detox as python -m detox Thanks André
    Caron (@AndreLouisCaron).
- (infrastructure) add Travis CI setup. Thanks Timothée Mazzucotelli
    (@Pawamoy).
- add "-n NUMPROC" option to set number of processes. The default is
    the number of CPUs as determined by multiprocessing.cpu_count() or
    "2" if the call does not work (e.g. on py27/windows). Thanks
    Timothée Mazzucotelli (@Pawamoy).

## 0.10.0


- get compatible again to tox-2.0

## 0.9.4

- get compatible again to eventlet by avoiding to import
    eventlet.processes, thanks Takeshi Komiya for the PR.
- make detox honor skipsdist. Thanks Timoth Messier for the PR.
- change license to MIT

## 0.9.3

- fix issue6: quickly make detox work with tox-1.6 again (although not
    all 1.6 features supported, e.g. --develop does not work)
- fix issue3: don't claim a TROVE identifier of "python3" because
    detox itself depends on eventlet which does not work on py3 yet.
    (Nevertheless detox will create py3 environments through tox of
    course)
- fix issue1: support python2.5 again (although we might drop it in
    the future -- it's enough of tox/detox can _[create]() and handle
    py25 environments, they don't neccessarily need to support running
    themselv on py25)

## 0.9.2

- fix issue4 - fail properly if sdist-packaging fails

## 0.9.1

- fix issue5 - small adjustments to work with latest tox-1.4.3 version

## 0.9

- initial release
